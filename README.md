# Dotfiles

All these settings and preferences are quite specific to me, myself and my Macbooks, use them as a reference rather than a "batteries included" setup

## Installation

I wouldn't recommend this as I don't have a comprehensive list of installed software, the dotfiles assume many things are already installed and this could break your dev environment.
